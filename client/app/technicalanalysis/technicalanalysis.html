            <p>Technical analysis began back to the 1800s.  People who perform technical analysis are referred to as “chartists” or “technicians” since much of their analysis takes the form of graphs or charts. </p>
            <p>Technicians believe that there are recurring patterns in the movement of stock prices. Once these patterns are discovered, they can be used to forecast the direction and perhaps the magnitude of future price changes.  Technicians also believe that investors will repeat their mistakes, failing to learn from either history or their own experience. <br>

              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent" >
                <p>Technical analysis is a method to evaluate securities by analyzing a stock’s market activity such as historical prices and volume.  Technicians look at the breadth of the stock market, the number of stocks with price increases, the number of stocks declining, their daily price changes, and the volume of the shares traded.  Technical analysts use charts and other tools to identify patterns that may suggest future activity.</p>
                <p>Technical analysis studies supply and demand of a stock in the stock market to try to determine what direction, or trend, will continue in the future. Technical analysis tries to understand the emotions in the stock market by studying the stock market itself. </p>
                <p>There are many different types of technical analysts.  Some rely on chart patterns, others use technical indicators, and some use some combination of the two.  A technical analyst's use of historical price and volume data is what separates her from her fundamental analysis counterparts.  The only thing that matters to a technician is a security's past trading data and what information this data can provide about where the stock will move in the future.</p>
                <p class="text_ital">Technical analysis is based on three assumptions:</p>
                <ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="text_bld">The market discounts everything </span><br>
                    Technical analysis assumes that, at any given time, a stock's price reflects everything that has or could affect a company including any fundamental factors.  Technical analysts believe that the company's fundamentals, along with broader economic factors, are priced into the stock. <br>
                  </li>
                  <li><span class="text_bld">Price moves in trends </span><br>
                    In technical analysis, price movements are believed to follow trends. This means that after a trend has been established, the future price movement is more likely to be in the same direction as the trend than to be against it. Many technical trading strategies follow this logic.<br>
                  </li>
                  <li><span class="text_bld">History tends to repeat itself </span><br>
                    An important idea in technical analysis is that history tends to repeat itself, mainly in terms of price movement. The repetitive nature of price movements is attributed to market psychology.   In other words, stock traders tend to react consistently to similar market situations over time.  Technical analysis uses chart patterns to analyze market movements and understand trends. Although many of these charts have been used for more than 100 years, they are still believed to be relevant because they illustrate patterns in price movements that often repeat themselves.</li>

              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent" >
                <p>One of the most important concepts in technical analysis is the trend.  A trend is the general direction in which a security or market is headed. As can be seen in Figure 1 below, the trend is up over the time frame shown.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure1" name="figure" width="300" height="300" id="figure"></p>
                <p>However, it's not always easy to see a trend as seen in Figure 2.  It isn't clear which direction this security is headed because there are many ups and downs in this chart.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure1" name="figure" width="300" height="300" id="figure2"></p>
                <h4>Defining Trends</h4>
                <p>Unfortunately, trends are not always easy to spot.  This is because stock prices do not tend to move in a straight line in any direction, but rather in a series of highs and lows.  It is the movement of these highs and lows that makes a trend.  For example, an uptrend is a series of higher highs and higher lows, whereas a downtrend is lower lows and lower highs. </p>
                <p>Figure 3 is an example of a stock price’s upward trend.  Point 2 in the chart is the first high, which is determined because the price falls from this point.  Point 3 is the low that is established as the price falls from the high at point 2.  For this to remain an uptrend, each successive low must not fall below the previous lowest point.  If the successive low falls below the previous lowest point, the trend is then known as a reversal.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure1" name="figure" width="300" height="300" id="figure3"></p>
                <h4>Trend Types</h4>
                <p class="text_ital">There are three types of trends:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="ul">Uptrends<br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul">Downtrends<br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul">Sideways/Horizontal Trends </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Highs are also known as peaks and lows are also known as troughs.  When each successive peak and low is higher, it is an upward trend. If the peaks and lows are getting lower, it's a downtrend. When there is little movement up or down in the peaks and lows, it's a sideways or horizontal trend. The sideways trend is not actually a trend, but a lack of a well-defined trend in either direction. </p>
                <h4>Trend Lengths<br>
                </h4>
                <p>There are three trend length classifications.  A trend can be a long-term trend, intermediate trend or a short-term trend.</p>
                <p> In the stock market, a long-term trend usually lasts longer than a year.  An intermediate trend lasts between one and three months and a short-term trend is anything less than a month. </p>
                <p>A long-term trend is composed of several intermediate trends.  These intermediate trends can sometimes move against the direction of the major trend.  If the major trend is upward and there is a downward correction in the stock price followed by a continuation of the uptrend, the correction is called an intermediate trend.  Short-term trends are components of both major and intermediate trends.  Figure 4 shows how these three trend lengths might look.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure1" name="figure" width="300" height="300" id="figure4"></p>
                <p>When analyzing trends, the chart should be designed to best reflect the type of trend being analyzed.  For example, to help identify long-term trends, weekly charts or daily charts spanning a five-year period are used to get a better picture of the long-term trend.  Daily charts are best when analyzing both intermediate and short-term trends.  As a rule of thumb, the longer the trend, the more important it is.  For example, a one-month trend is not as significant as a three-year trend.</p>

              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent" >
                <h4>Trendlines</h4>
                <p>A trendline is a straight line in the chart that represents the general trend in the market or a stock.  These lines show the trend and are also used to identify trend reversals.</p>
                <p>Figure 5 shows an upward trendline that is drawn at the lows of an upward trend.  This line represents the “support” the stock has every time it moves from a high to a low.  This trendline helps traders anticipate the point at which a stock's price will begin moving upwards again.  Similarly, a downward trendline is drawn at the highs of the downward trend.  This line represents the “resistance level” that a stock faces every time the price moves from a low to a high.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure1" name="figure" width="300" height="300" id="figure5"></p>
                <h4>Support and resistance<br>
                </h4>
                <p>A major concept of technical analysis is support and resistance.  Support is the low level a stock price hits during a period of time.  Support is like a floor for the stock price.  Resistance is the high level a stock price hits during a period of time.  Resistance is like a ceiling for the stock price.  During some time periods, the price of a security seldom moves above (resistance) or below (support).  Figure 7 shows support as the blue arrows and resistance as the red arrows.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure1" name="figure" width="300" height="300" id="figure6"></p>
                <h4>Why does it happen?<br>
                </h4>
                <p>Support and resistance levels are important in terms of market psychology and supply and demand. Support and resistance levels are where a lot of traders are willing to buy the stock (in the case of a support) or sell it (in the case of resistance).  When these trendlines are broken, the supply and demand and the psychology behind the stock's movements is thought to have shifted.  In these cases, new levels of support and resistance will probably be established.</p>
                <h4>Round numbers and support and resistance<br>
                </h4>
                <p>One type of universal support and resistance levels is round numbers.  Round numbers like 10, 20, 35, 50, and 100 tend be important in support and resistance levels.  They often represent major psychological turning points at which many traders make buy or sell decisions.</p>
                <p>Usually buyers will often purchase a stock once the price starts to fall toward a major round number such as $50, which makes it more difficult for shares to fall below the level.  Sellers start to sell a stock as it moves toward a round number peak.  This makes it difficult for the stock price to move past this upper level.  It is the increased buying and selling pressure at these levels that makes them important points of support and resistance.</p>
                <h4>Role reversal<br>
                </h4>
                <p>Once a resistance or support level is broken, its role is reversed.  For example, if the price falls below a support level, that old support level (floor) will become the new resistance level (ceiling).  As another example, if the price rises above a resistance level, that old resistance level (ceiling) will often become the new support level (floor).  For a true reversal to occur, it is important that the price make a strong move through either the support or resistance levels.</p>
                <p>For example, in Figure 8, the dotted line shows a level of resistance that has prevented the price from heading higher on two previous occasions (Points 1 and 2). Once the resistance is broken, it becomes a level of support (shown by Points 3 and 4) by propping up the price and preventing it from heading lower again.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure1" name="figure" width="300" height="300" id="figure7"></p>
                <p>In almost every case, a stock will have both a level of support and a level of resistance and will trade in this range as it bounces between these levels. This is most often seen when a stock is trading in a sideways pattern as the price moves through successive peaks and troughs, testing resistance and support.</p>
                <h4>The importance of support and resistance<br>
                </h4>
                <p>Support and resistance analysis is important because it can be used to make trading decisions and identify when a trend is reversing.  For example, if a trader identifies an important level of resistance that has been tested several times but never broken, he or she may decide to take profits as the security moves toward this point because it is unlikely that it will move past this level.</p>
                <p>A break beyond a level of support or resistance does not always have to be a reversal.  For example, if prices move above the resistance levels of an upward trending channel, the trend has accelerated, not reversed. This means that the price appreciation is expected to be faster than it was in the channel.</p>
                <p>Support and resistance levels should affect the way an investor trades a stock.  Traders should avoid placing orders at these major points, as the area around them can be marked by a lot of volatility.  If you're bullish on a stock that is moving down toward an important support level, it is best not to place the trade at the support level, but instead, place it above the support level, but within a few points. </p>
                <h4>Channels<br>
                </h4>
                <p>A channel, or channel lines, is two parallel trendlines that act as strong areas of support and resistance.  The upper trendline connects a series of highs, while the lower trendline connects a series of lows.  A channel can slope upward, downward or sideways.  Traders will expect a security to trade between the two levels of support and resistance until it breaks beyond one of the levels.  Then traders can expect a sharp move in the direction of the break.  Channels are mainly used to illustrate important areas of support and resistance.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure1" name="figure" width="300" height="300" id="figure8"></p>
                <p>Figure 6 illustrates a descending channel on a stock chart.  The upper trendline has been placed on the highs and the lower trendline is on the lows.  The price has bounced of these lines several times, but has remained range-bound for several months.  As long as the price does not fall below the lower support or rise above the upper resistance, the range-bound downtrend is expected to continue.</p>
                <h4>Trends are important<br>
                </h4>
                <p>It is important to be able to understand and identify trends.  Two important sayings in technical analysis are "the trend is your friend" and "don't buck the trend."   This shows how important trend analysis is for technical traders.</p>

            <div id="CollapsiblePanel3" class="CollapsiblePanel CollapsiblePanelClosed">
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelTab" tabindex="0">Volume of trades</div>
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent" >
                <h4>Volume</h4>
                <p>Volume is the number of shares that trade over a given period of time, usually a day.  The higher the volume, the more active the security.  To determine the movement of the volume (up or down), chartists look at the volume bars that can usually be found at the bottom of any chart. Volume bars show how many shares have traded per period and show trends in the same way that prices do.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure1" name="figure" width="300" height="300" id="figure9"></p>
                <h4>Why volume is important<br>
                </h4>
                <p>Volume is important because it can confirm trends and chart patterns.  Any price movement with relatively high volume is seen as a stronger move than a similar move with low volume.  If you see a large price movement, you should also examine the volume to see whether it tells the same story.</p>
                <p>For example, a stock jumps 5% in one trading day after being in a long downtrend.  Is this a sign of a trend reversal?  If that day’s volume is high relative to the average daily volume, it is a sign that the reversal is probably for real.  If the day’s volume is below average, there may not be enough conviction to support a true trend reversal.</p>
                <p>Volume should move with the price trend.  If prices are moving in an upward trend, volume should increase (and vice versa).  If the relationship between volume and price movement starts to deteriorate, it is usually a sign of weakness in the trend.  For example, if the stock is in an uptrend but the “up” trading days have lower volume, this indicates that the trend is starting to weaken and may end soon.</p>
                <h4>Volume and chart patterns<br>
                </h4>
                <p>Volume is also used to confirm chart patterns.  Patterns such as head and shoulders, triangles, and other price patterns can be confirmed with volume.  If the volume is low at the pivotal moments of a chart pattern, the pattern is weak.</p>
                <h4>Volume precedes price<br>
                </h4>
                <p>An important idea in technical analysis is that volume precedes price.  Technicians monitor volume to look for upcoming trend reversals.  If volume is starting to decrease in an uptrend, it is usually a sign that the upward run is about to end.</p>

                <h4>Charts<br>
                </h4>
                <p>A chart shows a series of prices over a set time frame.  For example, a chart can show a stock's price movement over a one-year period, where each point on the graph represents the closing price for each day the stock is traded:</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure1" name="figure" width="300" height="300" id="figure10"></p>
                <p>Figure 10 is an example of a chart.  It shows the price movements of a stock over a 1 &amp; ½ year period.  The lower part of the graph, running horizontally (x-axis), is the date or time scale.  The right hand side, running vertically (y-axis), is the price of the security.  By looking at the graph we see that in October 2004 (Point 1), the price of this stock was around $245, whereas in June 2005 (Point 2), the stock's price is around $265. This tells us that the stock has risen between October 2004 and June 2005.</p>
                <h4>Chart properties<br>
                </h4>
                <p>Charts have properties which are useful in understanding the information shown in the chart.   These include the time scale, the price scale, and the price point properties.</p>
                <h4>The time scale<br>
                </h4>
                <p>The time scale is the range of dates at the bottom of the chart.  The most frequently used time scales are intraday, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annually.  As a rule of thumb, the shorter the time frame, the more detailed the chart. </p>
                <p>Intraday charts plot price movements within one day. The time scale could be as short as five minutes or could include the whole trading day.</p>
                <p>Daily charts show a series of price movements in which each price point on the chart is a full day’s trading activity.  Each point on the graph can be the closing price or the open, high, low and close for the stock over the day.  These data points are spread out over weekly, monthly or yearly time scales to monitor short-term and intermediate trends in price movement.</p>
                <p>Weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly charts are used to analyze longer term stock price movement trends.  Each data point in these graphs will be a condensed version of what happened over the specified period.  For example, in a weekly chart, each data point represents the price movement of the week.  In a chart of weekly data spread over a five-year period with each data point representing the closing price for the week, the price plotted will be the closing price on the last trading day of the week, which is usually a Friday. </p>
                <h4>The price scale and price point properties<br>
                </h4>
                <p>The price scale is on the right-hand side of the chart.  It shows a stock's current price and compares it to past data points.  The price scale goes from lower prices to higher prices moving along the scale from the bottom to the top.</p>

                <p>Chart types<br>
                </p>
                <p>There are four main types of charts that are used in technical analysis.  </p>
                <p class="text_ital">These chart types are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="ul">the line chart<br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul">the bar chart<br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul">the candlestick chart<br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul">the point and figure chart</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Line chart<br>
                </h4>
                <p>The most basic chart is the line chart.  This chart only shows the closing prices over a period of time.  The line is formed by connecting the closing prices over the time frame.  Line charts do not show the high, low and opening prices.  The closing price is often considered to be more important than the high and low for the day and this is why it is the only value used in line charts.  Figure 12 is a line chart.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure1" name="figure" width="300" height="300" id="figure11"></p>
                <h4>Bar charts<br>
                </h4>
                <p>The bar chart expands on the line chart by adding more information to each data point.  This chart is a series of vertical lines that represent each data point.  This vertical line represents the high and low for the trading period, along with the closing price.  The close and open are represented on the vertical line by a horizontal dash.  The opening price on a bar chart is illustrated by the dash that is on the left side of the vertical bar.</p>
                <p> The close is represented by the dash on the right.  Usually, if the left dash (open) is lower than the right dash (close) then the bar will be shaded black, representing an up period for the stock, which means it has gained value.  A bar that is colored red indicates that the stock has gone down in value over that period.  When this occurs, the dash on the right (close) is lower than the dash on the left (open).  Figure 13 is an example of a bar chart.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure1" name="figure" width="300" height="300" id="figure12"></p>
                <h4>Candlestick charts<br>
                </h4>
                <p>The candlestick chart is similar to the bar chart in that there is a thin vertical line showing the period's trading range.  The difference is the formation of a wide bar on the vertical line, which illustrates the difference between the open and close.  Candlestick charts rely on different colors to explain what occurred during the trading period. </p>
                <p>One problem with the candlestick color configuration is that different chart sites use different standards.  Therefore, it is important to understand the candlestick configuration at the chart site you are working with. For example, when the price of the stock is up and closes above the opening trade, the candlestick could be white or clear.  If the stock is down for the period, then the candlestick could be red or black.  If the stock's price has closed above the previous day’s close but below the day's open, the candlestick will be black or filled with the color that is used to indicate an up day.  Figure 14 is an example of a candlestick chart.</p>

                <h4>Point and figure charts<br>
                </h4>
                <p>The point and figure chart is not used by the average investor.  This type of chart reflects price movements, but not time and volume.  The point and figure chart removes insignificant price movements in the stock which can distort the price trends.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure15" name="figure" width="300" height="300" id="figure14"></p>
                <p>Figure 15 is a point and figure chart.  The point and figure chart is a series of Xs and Os.  The Xs represent upward price trends and the Os represent downward price trends.  There are numbers and letters in the chart which represent the months.  Each box on the chart represents the price scale, which adjusts depending on the price of the stock: the higher the stock's price the more each box represents.  For example, where the price is between $20 and $100, a box represents $1, or 1 point for the stock.  The other critical point of a point and figure chart is the reversal criteria.  The reversal criteria show how much the price has to move away from the high or low in the price trend to create a new trend.  In other words, how much the price has to move in order for a column of Xs to become a column of Os, or vice versa.  When the price trend has moved from one trend to another, it shifts to the right, signaling a trend change. </p>

              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent" >
                <p>A chart pattern is a formation that creates a trading signal.  Chartists use these patterns to identify current trends and trend reversals and to trigger buy and sell signals.</p>
                <p>The theory behind chart patterns is the assumption that history repeats itself.  The idea is that certain patterns are seen many times, and that these patterns signal a high probability of a move in a stock.  Based on the historic trend of a chart pattern signaling a certain price movement, chartists look for these patterns to identify trading opportunities.  There is no chart pattern that will tell you with 100% certainty where a security is headed.  This is why charting is often seen as more of an art than a science.</p>
                <p>There are two types of patterns: reversal and continuation. A reversal pattern indicates that a trend will reverse course when the pattern is complete.  A continuation pattern signals that a trend will continue once the pattern is complete.</p>
                <p> There is a variety of chart patterns, each with its own unique name.  Here is a sample of some chart patterns.</p>
                <h4>Head and shoulders<br>
                </h4>
                <p>This is one of the most popular chart patterns in technical analysis. Head and Shoulders is a reversal chart pattern that when formed, signals that the security is likely to move against the previous trend.  Figure 16 shows two versions of the head and shoulders chart pattern.  On the left hand side, the head and shoulders top is a chart pattern that is formed at the high of an upward movement and signals that the upward trend is about to end.  On the right hand side, the head and shoulders bottom, also known as an inverse head and shoulders, signals a reversal in a downtrend.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure15" name="figure" width="530" height="300" id="figure15"></p>
                <p class="text_ital">Figure 16: Head and shoulders top is shown on the left. Head and shoulders bottom, or inverse head and shoulders, is on the right.</p>
                <p>Both of these head and shoulders patterns are similar in that there are four main parts: two shoulders, a head and a neckline.  The head and shoulders chart pattern illustrates a weakening in a trend by showing the deterioration in the successive movements of the highs and lows.</p>
                <h4>Cup and handle<br>
                </h4>
                <p>A cup and handle pattern is a bullish continuation pattern in which the upward trend has paused but will continue in an upward direction once the pattern is confirmed.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure1" name="figure" width="300" height="300" id="figure16"></p>
                <p>As you can see in Figure 17, this price pattern forms what looks like a cup, which is preceded by an upward trend.  The handle follows the cup formation and is formed by a generally downward/sideways movement in the security's price.  Once the price movement breaks above the resistance line formed in the handle, the upward trend can continue.  This pattern has a wide ranging time frame, with the span ranging from several months to more than a year.</p>
                <h4>Double tops and bottoms<br>
                </h4>
                <p>This chart pattern signals a trend reversal and is considered to be reliable. These patterns are formed after a sustained trend.  The pattern is created when a price movement tests support or resistance levels twice and is unable to break through. This pattern is often used to signal intermediate and long-term trend reversals.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure1" name="figure" width="530" height="300" id="figure17"></p>
                <p class="text_ital">Figure 18: A double top pattern is shown on the left, while a double bottom pattern is shown on the right.</p>
                <p>In the double top pattern shown in the left hand side of Figure 18, the price movement has twice tried to move above a certain price level.  After two unsuccessful attempts at pushing the price higher, the trend reverses and the price heads lower.  In the case of a double bottom (shown on the right), the price movement has tried twice to go lower, but has found support each time.  After the second bounce off of the support, the security enters a new trend and heads upward.</p>
                <h4>Triangles<br>
                </h4>
                <p>There are three types of triangles: the symmetrical triangle, ascending, and descending triangle. These chart patterns can last anywhere from a couple of weeks to several months.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure1" name="figure" width="530" height="300" id="figure18"></p>
                <p>The symmetrical triangle in Figure 19 is a pattern in which two trendlines converge toward each other. This pattern is neutral in that a breakout to the upside or downside is a confirmation of a trend in that direction.  In an ascending triangle, the upper trendline is flat, while the bottom trendline is upward sloping. This is considered a bullish pattern where chartists look for an upside breakout.  In a descending triangle, the lower trendline is flat and the upper trendline is descending. This is considered a bearish pattern where chartists look for a downside breakout.</p>
                <h4>Triple tops and bottoms<br>
                </h4>
                <p>Triple tops and triple bottoms are a reversal chart pattern.  These two chart patterns are formed when the price movement tests a level of support or resistance three times and is unable to break through.  This signals a reversal of the prior trend.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure22" name="figure" width="530" height="300" id="figure19"></p>
                <p>Triple tops and bottoms can be confusing during the formation of the pattern because they can look similar to other chart patterns.  After the first two support or resistance levels have been established, the pattern will look like a double top or bottom, which could lead a chartist to enter a reversal position too soon.</p>

              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent" >
                <h4>Price movements and moving averages</h4>
                <p>Chart patterns can show a lot of variation in price movement and this can make it difficult for traders to get spot a security's overall trend.  One method to help see overall trends in price movements is moving averages.  A moving average is the average price of a security over a period of time.  By plotting a security's average price, the price movement is smoothed out.  Once the day-to-day fluctuations are removed, traders are better able to identify the trend and increase the probability that it will work in their favor.</p>
                <h4>Simple moving average (SMA)<br>
                </h4>
                <p>The most common method used to calculate the moving average of prices is called the Simple Moving Average.  It takes the sum of all of the past closing prices over the time period and divides the result by the number of prices used in the calculation.  For example, in a 10-day moving average, the last 10 closing prices are added together and then divided by 10.  Figure 24 shows a moving average for 15 days as well as 50 days.  The longer-term moving average is less responsive to changing prices because there are more days used in the calculation.  Increasing the number of time periods in the calculation is one of the best ways to gauge the strength of the long-term trend.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure1" name="figure" width="300" height="300" id="figure20"></p>
                <p>The usefulness of this type of average is limited because each point in the data series has the same impact on the average regardless of where it occurs in the sequence. The critics argue that the most recent data is more important and, therefore, it should also have a higher weighting. This type of criticism has been one of the main factors leading to the invention of other forms of moving averages.</p>
                <h4>Uses of moving averages<br>
                </h4>
                <p>Moving averages are used to identify current trends and trend reversals as well as to set up support and resistance levels.</p>
                <p>Moving averages can be used to identify whether a security is moving in an uptrend or a downtrend depending on the direction of the moving average.  Figure 26 shows that when a moving average is heading upward and the price is above it, the security is in an uptrend.  A downward sloping moving average with the price below can be used to signal a downtrend.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure1" name="figure" width="300" height="300" id="figure21"></p>
                <p>Another method to identify a trend’s momentum is to look at the relationship of a pair of moving averages. When a short-term moving average is above a longer-term moving average, the trend is up.  When the long-term moving average is above a shorter-term moving average, this signals a downward movement in the trend.</p>
                <p>Moving average trend reversals are formed in two main ways: when the price moves through a moving average and when it moves through a moving average crossover. The first signal is when the price moves through an important moving average.  For example, in Figure 27, when the price of a security that was in an uptrend falls below a 50-period moving average, it is a sign that the uptrend may be reversing.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure27" name="figure" width="300" height="300" id="figure22"></p>
                <p>The other signal of a trend reversal is when one moving average crosses through another. For example, in Figure 28, if the 15-day moving average crosses above the 50-day moving average, it is a sign that the price will start to increase.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure27" name="figure" width="300" height="300" id="figure23"></p>
                <p>If relatively short moving averages, for example 15 days and 35 days, cross over, this could signal a short-term trend reversal. On the other hand, when two averages with relatively long time frames cross over, for example 50 days and 200 days, this could suggest a long-term shift in a trend.</p>
                <p>Moving averages can help identify support and resistance levels as well as provide useful support and resistance points.  It is not uncommon to see a stock that has been falling stop its decline and reverse direction once it hits the support of a major moving average.   A move through a major moving average is often used as a signal that the trend is reversing. For example, if the price breaks through the 200-day moving average in a downward direction, it is a signal that the uptrend is reversing.</p>
                <p><img src="" alt="figure29" name="figure" width="300" height="300" id="figure24"></p>
                <p>The most common time frames used to create moving averages are the 200, 100, 50, 20 and 10 day time frames.  The 200-day average is thought to be a good measure of a trading year, the 100-day average measures a half a year, a 50-day average represents a quarter of a year, a 20-day average measures a month and a 10-day average represents two weeks.</p>

              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent" >
                <p>Indicators are calculations based on the price and the volume of a security that measure such things as money flow, trends, volatility and momentum.  Indicators are used as a secondary measure to the actual price movements and add more information to the analysis of securities.  Indicators are used in two main ways: to confirm price movement and the quality of chart patterns, and to form buy and sell signals.</p>
                <p>There are two main types of indicators: leading and lagging. A leading indicator precedes price movements, while a lagging indicator is a confirmation tool because it follows price movement.  A leading indicator is thought to be the strongest during periods of sideways or non-trending trading ranges, while the lagging indicators are useful during trending periods.</p>
                <p>The two main ways that indicators are used to form buy and sell signals is through crossovers and divergence. Crossovers are when either the price moves through the moving average or when two different moving averages cross over each other. The second way indicators are used is through divergence.  This is when the direction of the price trend and the direction of the indicator trend are moving in the opposite direction. This signals that the direction of the price trend is weakening.</p>
                <h4>Accumulation/Distribution line<br>
                </h4>
                <p>The accumulation/distribution line measures money flows in a security. This indicator attempts to measure the ratio of buying to selling by comparing the price movement of a period to the volume of that period.</p>
                <p>This indicator keeps a running total over the period of the security.  Traders look for trends in this indicator to gain insight on the amount of purchasing compared to selling of a security.  If a security has an accumulation/distribution line that is trending upward, it is a sign that there is more buying than selling.</p>
