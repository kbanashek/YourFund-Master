            <p>A Mutual Fund is created by a company that invests in a collection of cash, stocks, bonds or other investments.  Buying shares of the fund means that you own a portion of all of the investments within that fund.  A mutual fund is run by a manager who chooses which investments to purchase.  The mutual fund can sell its shares at the net asset value (NAV) at any time.  The NAV value is calculated by adding the current market values of all securities in the fund’s portfolio, subtracting the liabilities, and then dividing the resulting figure by the number of the funds’ outstanding shares.</p>
            <p>Mutual funds are classified as either load or no-load funds.  Both types charge a management fee based upon the total dollars managed.  Load funds also charge a direct commission (load) at the time of purchase. This is called a front-end load. There are also back-end loads, which are charged when the investor sells his/her mutual fund shares.  A fund may charge a percentage of the NAV if shares are redeemed in the first year and a smaller percent in each subsequent year until the back-end load is reduced to zero.</p>
            <p>Another mutual fund expense is the 12b-1 annual fee.  This fee covers distribution expenses such as brokers’ commissions, marketing and advertising. </p>
            <p class="text_ital">Mutual Funds are classified according to their investment objectives:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Aggressive Growth Funds</span> seek to maximize capital gains.  They invest in new industries, fledgling companies, or industries that are temporarily out of favor.  They are characterized by investing in high risk and high return stocks, but do not have significant interest income or dividends.  These funds have growth potential in rising markets but are vulnerable to slumps and are therefore more attractive to risk-takers.</li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Balanced Funds</span> generally have a three-part investment objective: 1) to conserve the investors’ initial principal, 2) to pay current income, and 3) to have long-term growth of both principal and income.  This is achieved through a mixture of bonds, preferred stocks and common stocks.</li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Bond Funds invest</span> primarily in bonds.  Some funds may concentrate on short-term bonds, others on intermediate-term bonds, and still others on long-term bonds.  These funds offer dependable monthly income but rising interest rates can reduce the principal invested.  This type of fund is for investors who want income and are looking to diversify.  These funds are designed for low to moderate risk investors who seek a low to moderate rate of return.</li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Corporate Bond Funds</span> seek a high level of income by buying bonds of corporations for the majority of the fund’s portfolio.  They are for investors who seek a low to moderate rate of return.</li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Growth Funds</span> aim to increase in value over the long term and usually do not pay dividends.  They invest in companies that have strong earnings growth potential.  While growth funds are good for long-term growth, they do not offer protection from temporary market declines.  They are for long-term investors who want capital growth.</li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Growth and Income Funds</span> invest mainly in the common stock of companies that are expected to have an increasing share value and also have a solid record of paying dividends.</li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Income Funds</span> seek a high level of current income for their shareholders.  This may be achieved by investing in stock of companies which have good dividend paying records.</li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Index Funds </span>recreate a particular market index (e.g. the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500).  The investments in the fund and the return on those investments should mirror that of the index.</li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">International Funds</span> invest in the securities of foreign companies.  International funds can be vulnerable to currency fluctuations.  These can be for growth investors who want to diversify their portfolios.</li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Money Market Mutual Funds</span> invest in short-term securities sold in the money market.  The money market is where large companies, banks and other institutions invest their surplus cash for short periods of time.</li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Municipal Bond Funds</span> invest in bonds issued by local governments such as cities and states.  These entities use the money to build schools, highways, libraries, etc.  These are best for investors who are interested in lower risk. </li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Precious Metals Funds</span> invest in gold mining and other precious metals-related companies.  These funds are for investors who want a hedge against inflation.</li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Sector Funds</span> invest in one industry, such as biotechnology or retail, and thus are not as diversified as other mutual funds.</li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Total Return Funds</span> invest in high dividend paying bonds and stocks.  These have comparatively steady gains in a variety of market conditions, but have modest results in strong economic times.  These mutual funds are better suited for risk-averse investors looking for capital growth and moderate income.</li>
