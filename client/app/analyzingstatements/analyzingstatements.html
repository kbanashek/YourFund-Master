            <h3>Analyzing a company’s financial statements</h3>
            <p>In determining which company to invest in, you should analyze the company’s financial statements to see if the company is financially sound or has potential issues.  One way for you to analyze the financial statements is to create ratios which use data from a company’s balance sheet and income statement. </p>
            <p class="text_ital">Ratios can be categorized into four groups:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Liquidity ratios</span> indicate the company’s ability to pay its short-term debts.  Typically, these ratios are created by focusing on short-term items such as current assets and current liabilities.  It is also a good idea to analyze the company’s individual current assets and liabilities on their own, outside of the ratio.  For example, a relatively low cash level may indicate a significant liquidity problem, even though the relationship (ratio) between total current assets and current liabilities looks healthy.<br>
                <br>
                <span class="text_ital">Types of Liquidity Ratios:</span></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Current ratio</span> = current assets / current liabilities<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Quick or Acid ratio</span> = (current assets – inventory) / current liabilities<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Leverage ratios</span> measure a company’s use of debt financing and its ability to pay interest expense and other obligations associated with debt or “debt-like” financing.  There are four types of leverage ratios: debt ratio, debt/equity ratio, times interest earned, and fixed charge coverage.  Leverage ratios are created by measuring the company’s debt to its total assets or to the stockholder’s equity.  It is important to note that the higher the debt ratio, the more leveraged the company is and the higher the interest payments that they will need to make to their creditors. <br>
                <br>
                <span class="text_ital">Types of Leverage Ratios:</span></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Debt ratio</span> = total liabilities / total assets</li>
              <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Debt / Equity ratio</span> = long-term liabilities / stockholder’s equity</li>
              <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Times Interest Earned</span> = earnings before interest and taxes / interest expense</li>
              <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Fixed Charge Coverage</span> = (earnings before interest and taxes + lease expense) / (interest expense + lease expense)</li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Activity ratios</span> relate assets to revenue and are also known as turnover ratios. There are five types of activity ratios:  inventory turnover, asset turnover, fixed asset turnover,working capital turnover and average collection period. These ratios essentially measure how well a company is using its assets.  Higher ratios are generally more desirable because they are an indication of a healthier company.<br>
                <br>
                <span class="text_ital">Types of Activity Ratios:</span></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Inventory Turnover</span> = cost of goods sold / inventory</li>
              <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Asset Turnover</span> = sales / total assets</li>
              <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Fixed Asset Turnover</span> = sales / fixed assets</li>
              <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Working Capital Turnover</span> = sales / net working capital</li>
              <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Average Collection Period</span> = accounts receivable / average daily credit sales</li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Profitability ratios</span> show the relationship between profits, assets and sales.  These ratios measure how profitable a company is based on it’s net income (revenue less expenses).  Higher ratios are more desirable because they indicate  that a company is squeezing more profit from each dollar the company receives in sales.<br>
                <br>
                <span class="text_ital">Types of Profitability Ratios:</span><br>

              </li>
              <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Profit Margin</span> = net income / sales</li>
              <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Return on Investment</span> = net income / total assets</li>
              <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Return on Equity</span> = net income / stockholders’ equity</li>
              <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Earnings per Share</span> = net income / number of common shares outstanding</li>
              <li class="ul2"><span class="text_bld">Return on Assets</span> = earnings before interest and taxes / total assets<br>

            <h3>Trend analysis<br>
            </h3>
            <p>It is useful to calculate annual growth rates for key components such as revenues, earnings, and dividends.  These growth rates can be used in comparing the company with the industry average or other companies.  These trends can show over time if a company’s revenues, earnings, margins, expenses, etc. are increasing, staying flat, or declining.  If the revenues are increasing over time, but the expenses are staying flat or decreasing, the company is becoming more profitable and that is good.  If the sales are flat, but the expenses are increasing, that is troubling and you would need to see which type of expense is causing the increase.</p>
            <h3>Matters of size<br>
            </h3>
            <p>Publicly held companies can be classified by a term called “market capitalization”.  Market capitalization is the price per share of a company multiplied by the number of shares outstanding. </p>
            <p class="text_ital">There are three categories of capitalization: </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Large capitalization stocks</span><br>
                The stock of companies with market capitalization of more than $5 billion. Commonly referred to as “large-cap” stocks.</li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Mid-size capitalization stocks</span><br>
                The stock of companies with market capitalization between $500 million and $5 billion. Commonly referred to as “mid-cap” stocks.</li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Small capitalization stocks</span><br>
                The stock of companies with market capitalization of less than $500 million. Commonly referred to as “small-cap” stocks. </li>
            </ul>
