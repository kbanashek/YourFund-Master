<p>Inflation is an economic term used to describe the gradual tendency of prices to rise over time. It is based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) which is based on the prices of a market basket of goods. Inflation reduces the purchasing power of a dollar. If inflation is 3% per year, that means that prices, on average, will rise 3% over the next year, meaning that your dollar can purchase 3 cents less in a year than it can today. For example an apple costs $1.00 today. In one year, the apple may cost $1.05. The price has risen 5% and so the inflation rate for apples for that year is 5%. A dollar today would purchase one apple, but would not be enough to buy even one entire apple in a year.</p>
