            <p>Fundamental analysis and Technical analysis are the two main schools of thought in the financial markets for analyzing publicly traded stocks. </p>
            <p>Fundamental analysis uses formulas to examine the financial strength of a company.  Fundamental analysis involves looking into a company’s financial statements.  The analysis is based on factors such as the value of the company’s revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, earnings, dividends and other fundamental data.  Fundamental analysts look at this information to gain insight on a company's future performance. </p>
            <p>Technical analysis evaluates securities by analyzing a stock’s market activity such as historical prices and volume. Technical analysts use charts and other tools to identify patterns that may suggest future activity.  Technical analysis studies supply and demand of a stock in the stock market to try to determine what direction, or trend, will continue in the future. Technical analysis tries to understand the emotions in the stock market by studying the stock market itself. </p>
            <h3>The differences</h3>
            <ul>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Financial statements vs. Charts</span><br>
                A fundamental analyst focuses on the financial statements whereas a technical analyst approaches a security from the charts.<br>
                <br>
                By looking at the balance sheet, cash flow statement and income statement, a fundamental analyst tries to determine a company's value.  In financial terms, an analyst tries to measure a company's intrinsic value.  Investment decisions are fairly easy to make - if the price of a stock trades below its intrinsic value, it's a good investment.<br>
                <br>
                Technical traders believe there is no reason to analyze a company's fundamentals because these are accounted for in the stock's price. Technicians believe that all the information they need about a stock can be found in its charts.<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Time horizon</span><br>
                Fundamental analysis takes a relatively long-term approach to analyzing the market compared to technical analysis. While technical analysis can be used on a timeframe of weeks, days or even minutes, fundamental analysis often looks at data over a number of years.<br>
                <br>
                The different timeframes for these two approaches is a result of the nature of the investing style to which they each adhere.  It can take a long time for a company's value to be reflected in the market, so when a fundamental analyst estimates intrinsic value, a gain is not realized until the stock's market price rises to its "correct" value. This is called “value investing” and assumes that the short-term market is wrong, but that the price of a particular stock will correct itself over the long run. This "long run" can represent a timeframe of as long as several years.<br>
                <br>
                The numbers that a fundamentalist analyzes are only released over long periods of time. Financial statements are filed quarterly (every three months) and changes in earnings per share don't occur on a daily basis.  Fundamentals are the actual characteristics of a business.  New management can't implement sweeping changes overnight and it takes time to create new products, marketing campaigns, supply chains, etc.  Part of the reason that fundamental analysts use a long-term timeframe, therefore, is because the data they use to analyze a stock is generated much more slowly than the price and volume data used by technical analysts.<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul"><span class="text_bld">Trading vs. Investing</span><br>
                Technical analysis is more short term in nature than fundamental analysis, and the goals of a purchase (or sale) of a stock are usually different for each approach.  In general, technical analysis is used for a trade, whereas fundamental analysis is used to make an investment. Investors buy assets they believe can increase in value, while traders buy assets they believe they can sell to somebody else at a greater price. The line between a trade and an investment can be blurry, but it does characterize a difference between the two schools.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Can they be used together?</h3>
            <p>Although technical analysis and fundamental analysis are seen by many as polar opposites, many market participants have experienced great success by combining the two.  For example, some fundamental analysts use technical analysis techniques to figure out the best time to enter into an undervalued security. Often, this situation occurs when the security is severely oversold. By timing entry into a security, the gains on the investment can be greatly improved.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, some technical traders might look at fundamentals to add strength to a technical signal.  For example, if a sell signal is given through technical patterns and indicators, a technical trader might look to reaffirm his or her decision by looking at some key fundamental data.  Having both the fundamentals and technicals on your side can provide the best-case scenario for a trade.</p>
            <p>While mixing some of the components of technical and fundamental analysis is not well received by the most devoted groups in each school, there are certainly benefits to at least understanding both schools of thought.</p>
