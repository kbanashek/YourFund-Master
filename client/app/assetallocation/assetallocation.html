            <p>Let’s say you love pasta and decide to eat only noodles for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Your body would eventually have problems because it would not get the nutrients it needs from just one food source. You need to balance your diet with fruits, vegetables, grains and proteins to keep your body going.</p>
            <p>Just as you wouldn’t want to eat just one kind of food, you don’t want to put all your financial assets into one type of investment.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Asset allocation refers to dividing your investment portfolio among different types of asset classes, such as stocks, bonds and cash. Your asset allocations should change during various times in your life, depending on your time horizon and risk tolerance level.<br>
            </p>
            <h4>Why Asset Allocation Is So Important</h4>
            <p>By investing in asset classes that move up or down under different market conditions, you can better protect your portfolio against significant losses. Market conditions that cause one asset category to do well often cause another asset category to have average or poor returns.<br>
            </p>
            <p>With asset allocation, your portfolio's overall return will not fluctuate as wildly. If one asset category's investment return falls, you'll be in a position to counteract those losses with better investment returns in another category.<br>
            </p>
            <h4>Investment Choices<br>
            </h4>
            <p>There are many investment products to choose from such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds and exchange­traded funds. As noted above, investing in a variety of different assets is a smart strategy.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Stocks, bonds and cash are the most common asset classes. These are the asset categories you would likely choose from when investing in a retirement savings program or a college savings plan. Other asset categories include real estate, precious metals and other commodities. Investing in these asset classes typically is more risky. Before you make any type of investment, you should understand its risks.<br>
            </p>
            <h4>How to Get Started<br>
            </h4>
            <p>Determining the appropriate asset allocation strategy for your financial goal can be complicated. You are trying to pick a mix of investments that has the best chance of meeting your goal given your risk tolerance level. As you get closer to meeting your goal, you'll need to be able to adjust the mix of assets.<br>
              If you understand your time horizon and risk tolerance, you may feel comfortable creating your own asset allocation model. There is no single asset allocation model that is right for every financial goal. You'll need to do research and then choose the one that is right for you.<br>
            </p>
            <p>In most situations, it is best to diversify your asset allocation. But there maybe some circumstances when you choose not to vary the mix. For example, a 25­year­old who is investing for retirement in 40 years might invest entirely in stocks because she has the time she needs to recover from a possible falter in the stock market A family saving for a down payment on a house they want to purchase within the next few years might invest entirely in cash or CDs. The family needs to pay the down payment soon and cannot afford to take a chance on investing in the stock market in case the stock market goes down.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Neither strategy attempts to reduce risk by holding different types of asset categories. Choosing an asset allocation strategy won't necessarily diversify your portfolio. Whether your portfolio is diversified will depend on how you allocate the money in your portfolio among different types of investments.</p>

              <div class="CollapsiblePanelTabMain" tabindex="0">Changing Your Asset Allocations</div>
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent" style="display: block; visibility: visible; height: 937px;">
                <p>The most common reason for changing your asset allocations is a change in your time horizon. In other words, as you get closer to your investment goal, you'll probably change your asset allocations to less risky assets. <br>
                </p>
                <p>For example, most people investing for retirement hold less stock and more bonds andcash as they get closer to retirement age.  You may also need to change your asset allocations if there is a change in your risk tolerance, financial situation, or the financial goal itself.<br>
                </p>
                <p>Wise investors usually do not change their asset allocations based on the relative performance of asset categories.  For example, when the stock market is going up at a fast rate (a bull market), savvy investors would not increase the proportion of stocks in their portfolio.  Instead, they would "rebalance" their portfolios so as not to have too much of their investments in one asset class.</p>
                <h4>Rebalancing 101<br>
                </h4>
                <p>Rebalancing is basically adjusting your portfolio so that it is realigned back to your original, targeted asset allocations.  This is necessary because over time some of your investments may become out of alignment with your investment goals.  Over time, some of your investments will grow faster than others.  Rebalancing your investments ensures that your portfolio does not overemphasize one or more asset categories, thereby returning your portfolio to a comfortable level of risk.<br>
                </p>
                <p>For example, let's say you determined that stocks should represent 60% of your portfolio.  But after a recent stock market increase, stocks represent 80% of your portfolio.  You would need to either sell some of your stocks or purchase investments from an under-weighted asset class (such as bonds) to return to your original asset allocation mix.<br>
                  When you rebalance, you should review the investments within each asset allocation category.  If any of these investments are out of alignment with your investment goals, you will need to make changes to these investments to bring them back to their original allocations within the asset category.<br>
                </p>
                <p class="text_ital">There are three different ways to rebalance your portfolio:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="ul">Sell investments from over-weighted asset categories. <br>
                  </li>
                  <li class="ul">Purchase new investments for under-weighted asset categories. </li>
                  <li class="ul"><span class="ul">Modify the continuous contributions to your portfolio so that more investments go to under-weighted asset categories until your portfolio is back in balance. </span><br>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Before you rebalance your portfolio, you should consider the tax consequences or transaction fees that may result from each method of rebalancing.</p>
                <p>Stick with Your Plan: Buy Low, Sell High - Shifting money away from an asset category when it is doing well to an asset category that is doing poorly may not be easy, but it can be a wise move.  By cutting back on the current "winners" and adding more of the current so-called "losers," rebalancing forces you to buy low and sell high.</p>
                <h4>Rebalancing Strategies<br>
                </h4>
                <p>One rebalancing strategy is to adjust your portfolio on a regular basis, such as every six or twelve months.  The advantage of this method is that the calendar is a reminder of when you should think about rebalancing.<br>
                </p>
                <p>Another strategy is to rebalance only when the relative weight of an asset class increases or decreases more than a certain percentage, for example 15%.  The advantage of this method is that your investments tell you when to rebalance.  In either case, rebalancing works best on a relatively infrequent basis.</p>

              <div class="CollapsiblePanelTabMain" tabindex="0">Asset Allocation Strategies</div>
              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent" style="display: block; visibility: visible; height: 2163px;">
                <p>Setting up an appropriate mix of assets in your portfolio to meet your goal is a dynamic process and an important step in determining your portfolio’s overall risk and return. Your portfolio’s asset mix should reflect your goals at any given point in time. Here are a few asset allocation strategies to consider.<br>
                </p>
                <h4>Strategic Asset Allocation<br>
                </h4>
                <p>Strategic asset allocation establishes a “base policy mix.” This is a mix of asset classes in proportion to one another based on their expected rates of return. For example, if stocks have historically returned 10% per year and bonds have returned 5% per year, a mix of 50% stocks and 50% bonds would be expected to return 7.5% per year (50% * 10% + 50% * 5% = 7.5%).<br>
                </p>
                <p>This strategy creates an asset mix that will provide the optimal balance between expected risk and return for a long­term investment horizon. With this strategic allocation method, the investor selects certain investments that will hopefully minimize risk (i.e. bonds) and also selects other investments that generate an expected minimum return (i.e. stocks, mutual funds, or exchange traded funds).<br>
                </p>
                <p>It is a good idea to rebalance your portfolio at least once a year. This keeps your overall stock/bond ratio in the proportions you want as the ratios might be off from your target. Over time, stocks or bonds could outperform the other and make you overweight in stocks and underweight in bonds or vice versa. By rebalancing back to your target, you are taking some of your profit by selling high and reinvesting it in assets that are lagging, thereby buying low.<br>
                </p>
                <h4>Constant­Weighting Asset Allocation<br>
                </h4>
                <p>The constant­weighting strategy of allocating your assets enables you to continually rebalance your portfolio. For example, if one asset were declining in value, you would purchase more of that asset, and if that asset value should increase, you would sell some of it. A common rule of thumb to rebalance is that a portfolio should be rebalanced to its original mix when any given asset class moves more than 5% from its original value.<br>
                  The downsides of this strategy are that it is time­consuming and broker trading fees can get expensive.<br>
                </p>
                <h4>Tactical Asset Allocation<br>
                </h4>
                <p>Once in awhile you may want to consider deviating from your asset mix to take advantage of unusual or exceptional investment opportunities. This flexibility adds a component of market timing to the portfolio, allowing you to participate in economic conditions that are more favorable for a specific asset class. This is known as “tactical asset allocation”.<br>
                </p>
                <p>Tactical asset allocation is a moderately active strategy, since you would return to your overall asset mix when the desired short­term profits are achieved. This strategy requires discipline since you must be able to recognize when the short­term opportunities are finished, and then rebalance your portfolio back to your long­term strategy.<br>
                </p>
                <p>With the tactical strategy, you try to position your portfolio into those specific assets, sectors, or stocks that show the most potential for gains. Tactical investors try to buy into asset classes that are on an upward move. If you are someone who jumps out of stocks and into bonds when the stock market heads south, or dumps your money into gold because that’s the current hot commodity, you’re probably a tactical investor.<br>
                </p>
                <p>This asset allocation strategy is riskier than others because it is an active approach. Anyone can have a hot streak or get lucky, but don’t forget that even the best money managers can’t consistently outperform the market forever. This strategy is not well­suited for long­term assets such as those used for retirement.<br>
                </p>
                <h4>Dynamic Asset Allocation<br>
                </h4>
                <p>Dynamic asset allocation is also an active strategy where you constantly adjust the mix of assets as the stock and bond markets rise and fall and the economy strengthens and weakens. Dynamic asset allocation is the opposite of a constant­weighting allocation strategy. With the dynamic strategy, you sell assets that are declining and purchase assets that are increasing. If the stock market is declining, you sell stocks in anticipation of further decreases, and if the stock market is rising, you buy stocks in anticipation of continued market gains.<br>
                </p>
                <h4>Insured Asset Allocation<br>
                </h4>
                <p>In an insured asset allocation strategy, you determine a minimum “base portfolio value” floor, below which the portfolio should not be allowed to drop. As long as your portfolio achieves a rate of return above this base value, you can actively manage your portfolio to try to increase its value as much as possible. If the portfolio should ever drop to the base value, you would invest in risk­free assets such as US bonds, certificate of deposits, etc. so that the base value becomes fixed.<br>
                </p>
                <p>There are two different approaches to create the insured asset allocation strategy.<br>
                  The first is a formula approach. As the portfolio value decreases, you purchase more and more risk­free assets such as cash so that when the portfolio reaches its base level, you are entirely invested in risk­free assets.<br>
                </p>
                <p>The second is a portfolio insurance approach where you use options such as put options and/or futures contracts to preserve your base value. When the base amount is reached, you adopt a passive investing approach.<br>
                </p>
                <p>Both of these approaches are advanced active management strategies for more expert investors to use.<br>
                </p>
                <p>Insured asset allocation may be suitable for risk­averse investors who want some active portfolio management but appreciate the security of a guaranteed base value floor. If you want to establish a minimum standard of living during your retirement, an insured asset allocation strategy might be a good way to achieve your goals.<br>
                </p>
                <h4>Integrated Asset Allocation<br>
                </h4>
                <p>With an integrated asset allocation strategy, you consider both your economic expectations and your risk tolerance level in establishing an asset mix. Integrated asset allocation takes into account your expectations of the economy and stock market as well as the actual changes in the stock market and your risk tolerance level.<br>
                </p>
                <p>For example, if you think the economy will be very strong and the stock market will go up and you are not risk averse, you would invest more in stocks than in bonds.<br>
                  An integrated allocation strategy is a broader asset allocation strategy which allows for a dynamic or constant­weighting allocation. Obviously, an investor would not wish to </p>
                <p>implement two strategies that are competing with one another. For example, you would probably not integrate a dynamic strategy which is an active strategy with a strategic asset allocation strategy which is more long term in its approach.<br>
                </p>
                <h4>Core­Satellite Asset Allocation<br>
                </h4>
                <p><span class="text_ital">The core­satellite asset allocation strategy is a hybrid of both the strategic and tactical allocation strategies. With this strategy, your portfolio is essentially made up of two components:</span><br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="ul">A core holding of stocks, bonds, exchange­traded funds or index funds make up the majority of your portfolio. This is the strategic component of this core­satellite allocation. The core of your portfolio may consist of anywhere from 50­80% of your total portfolio.</li>
                  <li class="ul">The remaining portion of your portfolio is your satellite allocation which is a tactical approach. While your core holdings make up the majority of your portfolio and won’t change much over time, your tactical component allows you to investigate opportunities in the market. This is the active component of the strategy where you to try to take advantage of trends without risking your entire portfolio.<br>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This strategy is great for those who want to be more involved with their investments, but who are not risking their entire portfolio. With the majority of your holdings in a passive strategy, you will still generally follow the market with relative ease, but you also have the potential to enhance your gains (and possibly losses) by managing some of your money on your own.</p>
                <p><br>
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>

              <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent" style="display: block; visibility: visible; height: 367px;">
                <p>Asset allocation strategies can be an active or passive process or a mix of both.  Your choice of a specific asset allocation strategy or a combination of different strategies depends on your goals, time frame, market expectations, and risk tolerance level.</p>
                <p>Be aware that active allocation strategies that rely on anticipating and reacting to market movements require a great deal of expertise in order to try to time these movements.  Accurately timing the market is next to impossible, so make sure your strategy isn’t too vulnerable to unforeseeable situations.<br>
                </p>
                <h4>Which Strategy to Choose?<br>
                </h4>
                <p>There’s no right or wrong asset allocation strategy because it really depends on your comfort level and how active you want to be in managing your portfolio.  Most people will benefit from taking a traditional approach that consists of creating a tried and true mix of stocks and bonds suitable for their time frame and risk tolerance.  Obviously the recent recession and stock market performance has a lot of investors thinking twice about this strategy. </p>
                <p>So, what kind of asset allocation strategy should you use?  If you are thinking about adding some tactical investing to your portfolio, it’s important to keep trading costs down as frequent trading and commissions can have a negative impact on your total return.</p>
