            <p>Setting your investing goals is similar to taking a trip. When you plan a trip, first you select your
              destination, then you decide how you're going to get there. </p>

            <p>Let's say you live in Denver and want to visit Chicago. You could choose to fly, drive, or take a train.
              The type
              of transportation you choose depends on how much time you have, how long you plan to stay, and how much
              money
              you're willing to spend. If you have plenty of time to get to Chicago, you can drive. Driving means using
              a map
              or GPS to determine which route you will take, researching where you will eat and sleep, etc. If your time
              is
              limited, you might choose to fly to Chicago, checking with the airlines to see which carriers service that
              city,
              along with the flight times and fares. </p>

            <p>The same type of planning applies when setting your financial goals. First establish a specific goal,
              then map
              out a route of how to get there. Focus your goals on the events that have a significant financial impact
              in your
              life, such as getting married, raising a family, buying a home, funding a child's education, dealing with
              aging
              parents, and retiring. </p>

            <h3>Identify Your Financial Goals</h3>

            <p>Most people never take the time to identify their financial goals. They think about saving or investing
              in
              general terms, but don't specify what they are saving or investing for, nor do they think about how much
              money
              they will actually need to achieve their goals. </p>

            <p class="text_ital">Here are some examples of general financial goals:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="ul">Increase standard of living<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Have sufficient funds in the event of a serious illness<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Develop an investment program that will provide a hedge against inflation<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Accumulate a sizable estate to pass on to heirs<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Reduce debt<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Retire comfortably</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Think about what on this list applies to you and your lifestyle goals. Once you determine your general
              financial
              objectives, the next step is to focus on your specific financial objectives.</p>

            <p class="text_ital">Here are a few examples of specific financial goals:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="ul">Pay for college<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Buy a house<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Make home improvements such as remodeling a kitchen<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Buy a car<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Take a dream vacation to Europe<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Secure retirement income for at least 20 years<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Save in advance of having children<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Buy a retirement home<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Retire at the age of 60<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Start a small business</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Whereas a general goal might be "I want to retire comfortably someday," the specific goal would be "I
              want to
              retire at age 65 with enough funds to keep my current standard of living." Writing down clear and specific
              goals
              will help you identify your risk and investing preferences.</p>

            <p>When setting your goals, remember to be realistic about reasonable returns from various types of
              investments. For
              example, if you are risk-averse it helps to have goals that are more long-term and involve lower rates of
              return
              versus a short-term, high-risk, potentially high-return investments. </p>

            <h3>Factors to Consider when Setting Goals</h3>

            <p>Once you have identified your goals the next step is to prioritize them. There are four factors involved
              in
              prioritizing your goals. </p>

            <p class="text_ital">Each of them is equally important. They are: </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="ul">Investment Time Horizon<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Priorities<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Quantifying<br>
              </li>
              <li class="ul">Personal Investment Profile</li>
            </ul>
