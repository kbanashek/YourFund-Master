                        This is our philosophy - to teach individuals how to invest and enable them to control their investment decisions. Your Fund enables you to design and create a customized, tailored fund of investments that is suited to your goals, timeframe, and risk tolerance.
                        Once you register, you learn about investing before you design your own fund or funds. If you are already familiar with investing, you can go directly to creating and managing your funds.
                        Goal setting
                        Assess your financial goals, determine how much money you need to achieve these goals, and your timeframe for reaching these financial goals.
                        Risk
                        Know your risk tolerance level in order to appropriately select your investments.
                        Research
                        Analyze potential investments you want to include in your fund.
                        Create
                        Design and build your fund or funds with the investments you selected and choose weighting for each investment.
                        Manage
                        View how your funds are doing using graphs and transaction history. Add or withdraw money. Purchase or sell investments in your funds.
