                        Do you like the gaming tables in Las Vegas or Atlantic City? Do you wait until the gas gauge is almost on "E" before you fill up? If you answered yes to either, then you are probably a risk taker. Investing is ultimately a form of risk.<p></p>

                        The risk of investing in a security (for example a stock or bond) is the chance that the investment will decline in value and you will lose your initial investment as well as any potential future gains. For example, imagine that you buy shares in XYZ company that makes compact fluorescent light bulbs. Six months later, another company introduces a new light bulb that is less expensive and more energy efficient. Sales of compact fluorescent light bulbs plunge and so does XYZ company's stock price. The value of your investment is now below what you paid for it.<p></p>

                        Risk and return are directly related, so an investment that offers higher potential returns generally carries a higher risk. This is true in gambling as well. Let's say you're in Las Vegas playing Roulette. If you bet on number 18 at the roulette wheel, you have selected a very specific item with a 1 in 37 chance of winning. This is a very risky bet so if you win, you get a large payoff (return). On the other hand, if you bet on the color red (a more general bet), you have almost a 1 in 2 chance of winning. Thus the odds (risk) are lower, but the payoff is consequently smaller as well.<p></p>

                        Unlike gambling, however, investing in the stock market is not based purely on chance. It involves thoroughly researching a company, analyzing the company's track record and assessing its potential to generate future income. While gambling is a one-time, immediate event, smart investing occurs over a longer period of time.<p></p>

                        Generally, debt securities (i.e. bonds) have lower risks and offer lower returns while equity securities (i.e. stocks) have higher risks and offer higher returns. Highly risky investments, such as commodities (i.e. gold, silver) and hard assets (i.e. real estate), have the best potential for highest returns over time. However, these investments are the hardest to sell quickly and have the highest risk of declining in value.<p></p>

                        Your Risk Tolerance Level indicates your emotional and financial ability to tolerate investment losses. People who don't like to gamble have a low risk tolerance level while people who enjoy gambling tend to have a high risk tolerance level. Over time, your risk tolerance level may increase or decrease as your investment knowledge, net worth, income or age changes. Generally, the younger and/or wealthier you are, the more you can afford to make risky investments.<p></p>

                        Measuring Your Attitude Toward Risk<p></p>
                        It is a good idea to gauge your attitude about risk. The following statements can help you determine your risk tolerance level. Select "Yes", "No" or "Unsure" based on the assumption that you are investing money that will remain in the market over the next five years. Remember, there are no right or wrong answers.<p></p>
